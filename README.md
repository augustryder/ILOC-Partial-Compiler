# CSCI-3334 Compiler Construction
## Semester project: thc

* Name(s): August Herron
* Project Number: 3

### Overview
This repository will contain your code for all project components.
#
You must maintain backwards compatibility. You should also use tags or branches to mark each components' final submission, using tags p1 through p3. I would like if you updated the project number above as well.

You may pair-program on each project: choose one repository to work on. You will need Dr. Fogarty or Wen to add permissions to that repository. Your partner *can* change between assignments. If you add a new partner, decide whose code base to use for that project. If you stop working with a partner, make sure they get the chance to copy the existing code base.

If you pair-program an assignment, both people should put both names in their README.md files. However, only one person should submit the code. That person should be **the first name** in **both** README.md files.
